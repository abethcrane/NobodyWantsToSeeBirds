# nobody-wants-to-see-birds

Back in 2015 somebody thought it'd be a good idea to ask people for their ideas for HoloLens apps. Somebody submitted that given how nobody wants to see birds, it'd be good if we could make an app taht would render them invisible.

Now, that's hard in a nubmer of ways. Primarily because we can't actually render things invisible. But also just because you're not supposed to use a HoloLens outdoors, and birds don't tend to come indoors, and object recognition is very doable but not super cheap, especially when it's done dynamically.

Etc, etc.

But I couldn't let the idea lie.

Initially this game was just a simple HoloLens app - it generated birds (complete with sound effects), and then allowed you to not see them, by replacing them with a magenta cube. Delightfully offset so that you could still tell that the thing you weren't seeing was, in fact, a bird.

Now it's in the process of becoming a little 2D phone game.
